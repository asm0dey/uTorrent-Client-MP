```mvn clean package```

To launch you need only JRE installed on your computer - all the rest is included into application.

To create installers call

```mvn clean package -Pdeploy```

If you want to contribute you'll need to contact me to obtain copy of necessary JIDE libraries - we have a free license, but these libraries are not available in public repositories.
